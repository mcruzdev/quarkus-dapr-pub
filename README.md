# quarkus-dapr-pub

This project shows how to use Quarkus Dapr extension.


### Using the application

Clone the **mcruzdev/quarkus-dapr** extension branhc: `try-extension`.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:mcruzdev/quarkus-dapr.git
```

Go to the `try-devservices` branch:

```sh
git checkout try-devservices
```

Install with Maven:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

This project already is configured to use the version from the local maven repository.

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkiverse.dapr</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-dapr</artifactId>
      <version>999-SNAPSHOT</version>

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/quarkus-dapr-pub-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
